# Snake_Game
A snake game is an arcade maze game which has been developed by Gremlin Industries and published by Sega in October 1976. It is considered to be a skillful game and has popularized among people for generations. The snake in the Snake game is controlled using the four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in. The playerâ€™s objective in the game is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits. The player loses once the snake hits the wall or hits itself.

I developed Snake game using Python and the following libraris.
Turtle: It is a pre-installed python library that enables users to create shapes and pictures by providing them a virtual canvas.
Time: This function is used to count the number of seconds elapsed since the epoch.
Random: This function is used to generate random numbers in Python by using random module.
